"43","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics","They did the bare minimum expected of them! Yay? That's something worth celebrating now?"
"44","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics","Fox News is your ""friend"" that wants to fuck your girlfriend; but when they have have the balls to pull a move and are rejected they pull back. I wasn't saying ""that"", it was a joke, let's be friends... and your girlfriend looks pretty hot tonight, amirite?"
"45","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics",""
"46","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics","smh."
"47","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics","I am not sure Fox as a network was the issue. It was more the personalities they give their owns shows to: Judge Janine, Tucker, Laura, Hannity, F&Fs have kissed the cockring many times over and are more propagandists. Others like Wallace will grill both Democrats and Republicans, like a journalist."
"48","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics","""Let’s imagine for a moment a future election in which we don’t have the Electoral College"""
"49","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics","Lovely hypothetical, except for how easily I can knock your whole defense of the EC by turning it around: Imagine a past election without the EC. Oh, that's right, Trump would have lost and never been president. Thus we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place."
"50","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics","Fuck the EC."
"51","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics","Bush Jr would just be a former governor without the EC. Lots of crazy shit that laid foundation for Trump would never have come into being."
"52","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics","(If we were to abolish the Electoral College) Who would administer this national election? Presumably the national government. We don’t want to put words in the mouths of national popular vote supporters, but we can’t imagine any other way to do it."
"53","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics","THE STATES WOULD, YOU PINECONE!"
"54","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics","Jesus Christ! Just as I was grabbing my seat, enjoying the first four paragraphs of sodded sarcastic diatribe leading up to this ""very fine"" point, smell of freshly cut grass and icees and someone's powerful perfume wafting on the cool breeze, gazing upon the long track, reviewing my stamp for ""Man o' War To Place"", wondering if I shouldn't have doubled down on the certainty that this was going to be a fantastic article... you fucking fell off the goddamned horse at the gate!"
"55","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics","NOTHING about the administration of our elections would change if we were to abolish the EC. And that's kind of the point. The only difference is that on January 6th congress reads aloud the state vote totals and not the state electoral vote totals."
"56","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics","The only difference is that instead of the President of the Senate handling 538 items, reading aloud into the congressional record the vote of each elector, he or she would handle 51 items, reading aloud into the congressional record the vote total of each state."
"57","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics","That's literally the only difference. You can still request or pay for recounts, you can still have audits, etc. etc. There is still a state certification process no different from what we have now. The only difference is what we send to congress to be read into record. 538 votes or the will of the people."
"58","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics","...that's an incredibly stupid pun."
"59","The Electoral College graduates with honors : politics","Which means the GOP will begin desperately trying to undermine it."
"65","After Electoral College Votes, More Republicans Warily Accept Trump’s Loss : politics","And that shows their true nature right there. Wary of accepting democracy and the will of the people. What the fuck? Fuck the GOP."
"66","After Electoral College Votes, More Republicans Warily Accept Trump’s Loss : politics","Too late. No dice. All complicit."
"67","After Electoral College Votes, More Republicans Warily Accept Trump’s Loss : politics","5th stage of grieving: Acceptance."
"68","After Electoral College Votes, More Republicans Warily Accept Trump’s Loss : politics","Is this just going to be how they operate going forward? Should we expect childish outbursts, pathetic lawsuits, and refusal to accept reality in literally every election Republicans lose from now on?"
"69","After Electoral College Votes, More Republicans Warily Accept Trump’s Loss : politics","Because...god damn, weren't they the guys trying to say ""facts not feelings""? Pretty fucking pathetic if you ask me."
"70","After Electoral College Votes, More Republicans Warily Accept Trump’s Loss : politics","and how they betrayed America."
"71","After Electoral College Votes, More Republicans Warily Accept Trump’s Loss : politics","It's not as if they are literally the ""swamp"" waiting to see what they can say while still maintaining their personal status quo."
"72","After Electoral College Votes, More Republicans Warily Accept Trump’s Loss : politics","That's all been drained, and these guys are finally finding their spines and rising up."
"73","After Electoral College Votes, More Republicans Warily Accept Trump’s Loss : politics","They legitimately see once and for all that the emperor has no clothes, why would anyone say they're naked too?"
"74","After Electoral College Votes, More Republicans Warily Accept Trump’s Loss : politics","Shucks, poor gimps didn't get to go full mental banana republic on everyone. What a fucking disgrace."
"80","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","He can't even just not be a piece of shit. It's like he has to go above and beyond to be total scum."
"81","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","He wants to appear as strong(man) for his misguided cult."
"82","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","Of all the insane bullshit this guy has pulled the past four years, this is the one that I really don't get. There isn't any measurable political benefit. There's no profit motive. Is he speeding up executions due to some desire to play God? I wonder what Mary Trump would say about this."
"83","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","The cruelty is the point."
"84","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","To say he was strong. In general and on law and order. Small d*ck syndrome."
"85","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","He has the power to muder people legally and he likes it."
"86","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","He can use it for his base."
"87","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","Because he can. He's on a power trip-he is desperate to be remembered as a strong and powerful leader, so what better way to do that is carry out executions? He is innately cruel, amoral and sociopathic, so he's happy to be remembered as the president who killed more prisoners than any other. To his twisted mind, that's a good thing. Look how he worships Kim Jong-Un, Trump would have loved to have been the sort of totalitarian leader who could demand executions at the drop of a hat like he can do, so ramping up federal executions is his way of satisfying that craving. He is seriously psychologically and mentally unwell."
"88","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","He's obsessed with superlatives. He just wants to do the most of stuff so he can claim to be the best."
"89","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","He's trying to go out in style: veto a military spending bill over delusional demands and then be humiliated by its override, continue to rack up losses in his mendacious election court campaign, pardon every crony deemed sufficiently loyal, and execute a bunch of death-row inmates to provide his supposed law and order bona fides."
"90","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","This was probably part of his goals before he left the White House."
"91","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","A bucket-of-blood list"
"92","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","Just imagine dying at this dimwit's behest."
"93","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","A good percentage of 300,000+ Americans already got to experience that."
"94","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","How fucking undignified."
"95","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","Not to mention Trump's behaviour. He wouldn't know how to behave presidentially if his life depended on it. I'm sure Melania would try to help him, tell him to Be Best and all, but still he'd fall short."
"96","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","And yet he was holding up that Bible .... like a good prop."
"97","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","He wasn't out front of the one that had its BLM banner burned this weekend oddly enough."
"98","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","I'm fairly sure he started doing the forward facing fist pump after he got out of the hospital. Anyone know exactly? I think it's a fairly recent thing and I hate it. Who does that?"
"99","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","What a sick and disgusting thing to embrace as part of a legacy."
"100","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","Cold blooded old times"
"101","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","This guy gets me completely sick"
"102","Trump's Executions Will Be Most of Any President in Over a Century : politics","trump loves to execute people but hates to execute plans"
